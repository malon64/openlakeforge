"""Verify-then-commit for a `ScaffoldPlan`.

Nothing is written to the real repository until the plan has been proven
valid in an isolated temp tree: the canonical descriptor model plus both
JSON Schemas, exactly as `olf contracts check` validates the committed
descriptors. On any failure, zero files are written and `lakehouse.yaml` is
left byte-identical.

Concurrent `olf ... new` invocations against the same repo checkout are not
supported: no cross-process lock guards the check/verify/write sequence, so
two commands that both finish verification before either writes can race --
the second write silently drops the first command's `lakehouse.yaml`
addition while leaving its files on disk. This is a deliberate scope
boundary, not a silent-corruption risk: like `rails generate`, `cargo new`,
or `ng generate`, this tool assumes one command runs against a given
checkout at a time, and a lost race is immediately caught by the very next
`olf contracts check` (or scaffold command), which fails loudly on files
undeclared in the descriptor -- not accepted unnoticed.
