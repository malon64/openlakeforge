"""Injectable executable resolution.

Tool adapters must resolve executables through an `ExecutableResolver`
rather than calling `shutil.which` directly. `ManagedExecutableResolver`
(#127) is the managed-toolchain resolver this docstring originally
anticipated: managed tool names (`terraform`, `helm`, `kubectl`, `kind`) are
provisioned from `release/component-catalog.yaml` under `OLF_HOME`; every
other name (`docker`, `aws`, `az`, `uv`, `git`, ...) falls through to the
host `PATH`, unchanged from before #127.
