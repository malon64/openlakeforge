"""The contract every provider adapter must satisfy, asserted once per provider.

The per-module tests next to this one each cover one adapter. Nothing before
this suite asserted that *every* adapter satisfies the same contract, so an
adapter could diverge and only fail at runtime, on the provider nobody
exercises locally (issue #188).

The parameter list is `olf.deployment.context.Provider` itself rather than a
literal list, so a provider is enrolled the moment the enum names it: adding
one fails here — with a message naming the contract it broke — until its
`DeploymentContext` factory, its `build_provider` branch, its captured
contract fixture, and its Terraform root all exist.

Runs with no cluster and no cloud credentials: every provider is built from an
empty environment, every subprocess goes to a recording runner, and the
provider contract each root emits is read from the captured fixture beside
this file. What that leaves uncovered is one thing only — that a real
`terraform apply` of a root emits exactly the fixture's payload. That needs
Terraform and a provider account, and stays with `olf e2e run`. The two static
checks here (the root declares a v3 stage-indexed contract surface, and the
outputs shared tooling reads) are what catch a root drifting away from its
fixture in the meantime -- as presence checks over an opaque expression
string, not as proof that each field is pinned to its own stage.

Assertions are written against what a caller can observe. The destructive-apply
guards are driven through each provider's platform apply rather than called
directly, so a provider whose apply stops invoking them fails here; the
Protocol check binds Protocol-shaped calls rather than comparing signature
text, so an adapter may be rewritten freely as long as shared callers still
work; and cross-provider equality covers only the logical identities olf itself
derives, never physical names the provider contract owns.

    Scope, stated because the criterion is broader than this test: the Dagster

    the root passes it, and nothing here evaluates that. `olf check contracts`
