"""Shared classification data for provider-contract conformance suites.

`test_provider_conformance.py` and `test_multi_stage_conformance.py` (#155)
both compare a `build_contract_env` result against a real captured provider
contract, and both need to know which emitted variables are stage-bound
(must equal the contract), derived from a stage-bound one, or gated on a
capability rather than a stage. Sharing one classification here is what
keeps the two suites from drifting apart on what a stage-carrying export is
-- duplicating the lists would let one suite's copy fall out of date with
the exports `olf/contracts.py` actually emits while the other still passed.
