# No per-stage aws_glue_catalog resource: this account's Glue service
# rejects CreateCatalog for a plain ("native") data-lake-access catalog
# (InvalidInputException: "Create glue native catalog is not supported"),
# confirmed directly against the AWS API, not just this module's config.
# Every stage instead shares the account's one default catalog
# (glue_catalog_id = account_id, see outputs.tf); isolation moves to the
# physical database name, prefixed per stage by
# olf.contracts.resolve_physical_names's namespace_prefix.

# Database lifecycle moved to Phase 2 (ADR 0002): `olf catalog sync-namespaces`
# reconciles Glue databases from the lakehouse descriptors
# (lakehouse_code/lakehouse.yaml + bronze source.yaml) during artifacts-deploy,
# the same way it already reconciles Polaris namespaces. This root no longer
# creates or destroys databases -- it only stands up the catalog service.
#
# `removed` forgets the resource from state without deleting the underlying
# Glue databases, so an existing deployment's tables survive the upgrade. This
# block can be dropped once every environment has applied past this change.
