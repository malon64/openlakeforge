# ADR 0011: Deployment Profile v1 — provider, stage, and preset

## Status

Binding.

## Context

v0.3 (`#111`) introduces shared lifecycle stages (`dev`, optional `uat`,
`prod`) and exact-revision promotion between them on one Kubernetes cluster.
Building that requires one versioned, user-facing description of what a
deployment should look like, resolved before any Terraform, Helm, or
Kubernetes object exists.

Before this record, `olf deploy --provider local --profile slim|full`
conflated four separate concepts behind two flags:

- **provider** — where the deployment runs (`local`, `aws`, `azure`);
- **stage** — a shared lifecycle boundary (`dev`, `uat`, `prod`);
- **preset** — a named default/override set for optional capabilities
  (`slim`, `full`);
- **runtime** — the query engine a stage uses (only Trino exists today).

`--profile` names the preset but reads as an environment; ADR 0002 already
warns "`--profile` is not a phase," and ADR 0009 called the project-root
`openlakeforge.yaml` "a structural marker pending its semantic resolver."
Neither record gave the four concepts distinct types. This ADR does.

## Decision

### The four concepts stay distinct types throughout the resolver

| Concept | Values (v1) | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider | `local`, `aws`, `azure` | `spec.provider.type` |
| Stage | `dev`, `uat` (optional), `prod` | `spec.stages.<name>` |
| Preset | `slim`, `full` | `spec.preset` |
| Runtime | not exposed — Trino only | not a v1 field |

A provider is not a stage. A stage is not a Kubernetes cluster — v0.3 runs
every stage on one shared cluster. A preset is a default/override set for
optional per-stage capabilities, not a second architecture. Runtime choice
stays out of the schema entirely while Trino is the only supported
shared-stage runtime; adding it later is an additive schema change, not a
retrofit.

### Deployment Profile v1

The project-root `openlakeforge.yaml` describes product intent only:

```yaml
apiVersion: openlakeforge.io/v1alpha1
kind: DeploymentProfile

metadata:
  name: acme-data

spec:
  provider:
    type: aws
    region: eu-west-3

  preset: slim

  stages:
    dev:
      enabled: true

    prod:
      enabled: true
      capabilities:
        analytics: true
        governance: true
```

`tools/olf/olf/profile.py` models this as frozen typed value objects
(`DeploymentProfile`, `ProviderSpec`, `StageSpec`, `StageCapabilities`) and
resolves it into a separately typed `DeploymentTopology`. The desired and
resolved shapes are never the same object: `DeploymentProfile` is what the
user wrote, `DeploymentTopology` is the one effective, fully-defaulted result.
Validation is layered the same way as the Lakehouse/Source descriptors (ADR
0005): a hand-rolled parser in `olf/profile.py` for actionable, fail-closed
errors, and `docs/schema/deployment-profile.schema.json` for the versioned,
tool-checkable shape. Neither substitutes for the other, and both are
exercised by `olf check contracts`.

### Resolution is deterministic

| Input | Effective result |
| --- | --- |
| Stage absent from `spec.stages` | Disabled; PROD is never created implicitly |
| Stage present, `enabled` omitted | `enabled: true` |
| Stage present, no `capabilities` | Preset default (`slim` → both `false`, `full` → both `true`) |
| Stage present, capability stated | Explicit value wins over the preset |
| Disabled stage | Capabilities always resolve to `false`, regardless of what was written |

### Fail-closed validation

Unknown fields at any level, an unsupported `apiVersion`/`kind`, an unknown
stage name, an unsupported `preset` or `provider.type`, no stage enabled at
all, a `region` set for `provider.type: local`, and a `uat`/`prod` stage
enabled while `dev` is disabled (every promotion in the v0.3 model sources
from DEV) are all rejected before a resolved topology is produced.

### v1 frozen exclusions

The following are not v1 profile fields, because no provider adapter maps
them to anything real yet — a field with no implemented, testable mapping
becomes a no-op promise, which is worse than deferring it:

`runtime`, personal workspace policy, platform/compute/storage sizing or
availability, raw namespaces, replicas, resources, Helm values, Terraform
modules or backends, IAM policies, credentials, images, PVCs, buckets,
catalogs, and generated endpoints. `DeploymentTopology` carries only logical
service identities (`catalog`, `query`, `metadata_database`, `governance` as
shared services; `orchestration`, `reporting` per stage) — never namespaces,
Helm releases, or endpoints. The typed provider-contract v3 resolver derives
those from this topology (ADR 0003); #133 and #114 will make the platform root
and provider adapters emit and provision the resolved bindings. None belongs in
this profile.

### The v0.2 compatibility path

`olf deploy --provider local --profile slim|full` keeps its exact current
behavior as a deprecated shorthand: `olf.profile.legacy_single_stage_topology`
resolves it to one enabled DEV stage using the preset's capability defaults,
proving the shorthand is exactly the single-DEV-stage case of the general
model.

`DeploymentContext` now carries the resolved topology and the selected stage.
With no `--profile`, the project-root Deployment Profile is authoritative; an
explicit `--profile slim|full`, or a project that has no profile file at all,
resolves the single-DEV shorthand instead. A profile file that exists but is
invalid fails closed. Namespaces are derived from the topology but are not
part of it: `olf-system` for shared services and `olf-<stage>` per enabled
stage live in `olf.deployment.context`, since ADR 0011 keeps the resolved
topology free of namespaces, Helm releases, and endpoints.

## Consequences

- `olf profile validate` and `olf profile resolve --json` expose the
  effective topology before any mutation, for both humans and CI.
- Every later v0.3 issue (`#133`, `#114`, `#154`, `#115`, …) consumes
  `DeploymentTopology`, not `--profile`/`--provider` flags directly, once it
  lands.
- Local, AWS, and Azure POC shapes are representable without credentials,
  sizing, or endpoints — those stay behind provider contracts (ADR 0003).

## History

New record. No prior ADR modeled provider, stage, and preset as distinct
types; ADR 0002 and ADR 0009 are corrected in place to stop describing
`--profile` as an environment or the profile file as inert.

2026-08-28: Updated the provider-contract handoff after v3 established the
typed topology-to-provider boundary; no profile fields were added.

2026-08-29: The topology reaches Terraform (#133). `DeploymentContext`
resolves it, the local platform root consumes it as typed variables, and
namespace derivation is recorded as living outside the topology. No profile
fields were added.
