# Floe OpenLineage Capture Test Plan

This test plan verifies whether the configured Floe OpenLineage behavior works inside
OpenLakeForge before lineage is re-enabled in OpenMetadata.

The test deliberately captures Floe events first, instead of sending them
directly to OpenMetadata. That separates event-shape validation from
OpenMetadata entity matching and makes regressions easier to diagnose.

## Goal

Prove that Floe emits valid Bronze-to-Silver OpenLineage events for the current
OpenLakeForge runtime:

- `run.runId` is UUID-shaped.
- `inputs` and `outputs` are present on completion events.
- S3 Bronze dataset names are bucket-relative and do not start with `/`.
- Iceberg Silver output datasets use the expected catalog namespace.
- OpenLineage job namespace and job name are separated correctly.
- OpenMetadata can later match the same event stream without the removed proxy.

This test does not validate dbt Silver-to-Gold lineage. That remains blocked by
the former DuckDB/`openlineage-dbt` dataset namespace issue. dbt-trino is tested
separately in ADR 0018; Floe remains blocked on its configurable endpoint.

## Preconditions

| Requirement | Expected State |
| --- | --- |
| Local stack | `make local-foundation-up` and `make local-up` have completed. |
| Floe runner image | Rendered profile and generated manifests use the current configured Floe runner image. |
| OpenLineage proxy | Not deployed. The test uses a temporary capture endpoint. |
| dbt OpenLineage | Disabled. The test isolates Floe events only. |
| Target product | Start with one small path, preferably `sales_order_revenue_pipeline`. |

## Capture Endpoint

Create a temporary in-cluster HTTP endpoint that records every POST body and
returns a 200/202 response. The endpoint must expose one route compatible with
Floe's OpenLineage client configuration, for example:

```text
http://openlineage-capture:5000/api/v1/lineage
```

The endpoint should persist captured JSON events long enough to copy them out of
the pod after the test. A minimal Python/Flask or Python `http.server` based
container is enough. It does not need authentication for the first capture pass.

## Test Flow

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Deploy the capture service in the `lakehouse` namespace. | `openlineage-capture` is reachable from Floe runner pods. |
| 2 | Render a temporary Floe profile with a `lineage` block pointing at `http://openlineage-capture:5000/api/v1/lineage`. | The generated profile differs only by lineage settings. |
| 3 | Regenerate one product manifest with the temporary lineage-enabled profile. | The manifest still uses the configured Floe runner image and the normal OpenLakeForge storage/catalog contracts. |
| 4 | Upload the temporary manifest to the ops bucket path that Dagster passes to the Floe runner. | The runner can read the same manifest URI Dagster launches. |
| 5 | Launch a narrow Dagster run, preferably `sales_order_revenue_pipeline`. | Bronze and Silver assets succeed, and the capture endpoint receives OpenLineage events. |
| 6 | Copy captured event JSON from the capture pod. | The event payloads are available locally for validation. |
| 7 | Validate `run.runId` on every event with a UUID parser. | No event uses an old `mfv1-...` style run ID. |
| 8 | Validate COMPLETE events have non-empty `inputs` and `outputs`. | Bronze source datasets and Silver Iceberg output datasets are present. |
| 9 | Validate S3 input dataset names. | Names are bucket-relative paths such as `bronze/sales/...`, never `/bronze/sales/...`. |
| 10 | Validate job naming. | `job.namespace` carries the namespace and `job.name` is not prefixed by the Polaris REST URI. |
| 11 | Validate Iceberg output dataset naming. | Output datasets can be mapped to OpenMetadata's `polaris.<catalog>.<product>_silver.<table>` entities. |
| 12 | Restore the normal lineage-disabled manifest/profile and rerun artifact deploy if needed. | Normal local stack behavior is restored. |

## Optional OpenMetadata Acceptance Pass

Only run this after the capture pass succeeds.

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Point Floe lineage at OpenMetadata's native OpenLineage endpoint. | Floe can submit events without the deleted OpenLineage proxy. |
| 2 | Run the same narrow product path. | OpenMetadata accepts the events. |
| 3 | Inspect the lineage graph for the tested entity. | Bronze bucket container lineage connects to the Silver Iceberg table. |
| 4 | Keep dbt lineage disabled. | The test does not mix in the still-blocked Silver-to-Gold dbt lineage path. |

## Pass Criteria

The Floe debt can move from `Resolved Upstream, Pending Verification` to
resolved only when all of these are true:

- The configured Floe runtime image is used by the launched runner pod.
- Captured events satisfy the event-shape checks above.
- OpenMetadata can accept the Floe events directly.
- OpenMetadata resolves at least one Bronze-to-Silver lineage edge without a
  normalizing proxy.

## Failure Triage

| Failure | Likely Cause | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No events captured | Lineage block not rendered into the profile or manifest; runner pod cannot reach capture service. | Inspect generated manifest, runner pod env, and capture service DNS. |
| Non-UUID run IDs | The launched pod is not using the configured Floe runtime image or there is a Floe regression. | Check runner image in pod spec and captured event payload. |
| Empty inputs/outputs | Floe emission regression or unsupported entity path. | Reproduce with one CSV-to-Iceberg entity and compare with Floe issue #382 expectations. |
| S3 names start with `/` | Floe S3 dataset-name fix is not active. | Confirm runtime image and file upstream regression if needed. |
| OM accepts events but shows no edge | Dataset namespace/name no longer matches OM storage or Polaris entities. | Compare captured dataset names with OM container/table FQNs. |
