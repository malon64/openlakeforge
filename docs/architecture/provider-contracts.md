# Provider Contracts

OpenLakeForge platform modules exchange provider-neutral contracts instead of
allowing runtime code or project descriptors to select infrastructure directly.
The contract is the portability boundary: the same project can use Polaris and
SeaweedFS locally or on Azure, and Glue and S3 on AWS.

Terraform remains the source of physical provider values. `olf` parses those
values, validates them against the resolved Deployment Profile topology, and
derives the environment consumed by Floe, dbt, Dagster, Superset, and metadata
reconciliation. Product-owned descriptors contain logical identities only.

## Versions and deployment phases

Every Terraform root (local, AWS, Azure) now emits native `3.0.0` contracts.
`olf` retains a v2 adapter that lifts a flat `2.0.0` contract to a single
DEV-stage v3 view, but only to keep reading a contract from state a pre-v3
deploy already produced — no current root's Terraform emits that shape.
Unknown versions fail closed.

`3.0.0` is the binding stage-aware shape, represented by strict schema, typed
parser, and local, Azure, and AWS fixtures. A native v3 runtime must select a
stage explicitly. No profile or project descriptor receives a bucket, catalog,
provider adapter, credential, or generated endpoint.

`olf deploy` has three ordered phases:

1. Foundation creates the cluster and registry.
2. Platform creates static Terraform-managed services.
3. Artifacts deploys data-project-derived images, manifests, reports, and
   metadata.

The static/dynamic boundary is between platform and artifacts. A code commit
runs artifacts only; platform never waits for project artifacts.

## v3 contract shape

Every v3 document has these top-level fields:

- `deployment`: logical profile name, provider, and region, verified against
  `DeploymentTopology`.
- `shared`: foundation, cluster, metadata database, query, optional catalog or
  governance service, registry, ops storage, secrets, identity/access, and
  observability.
- `stages`: one entry for every enabled DEV/UAT/PROD stage, and no disabled
  stages.

Each stage owns its namespace, distinct Bronze/Silver/Gold storage bindings,
catalog and query bindings, orchestration, capability-dependent reporting and
governance bindings, runtime identity, activation prefix, and endpoint
references. Stage-scoped bindings (storage identity, orchestration, reporting,
governance endpoints, and the stage's own catalog endpoint) may reference only
`shared/*` or the issuing stage's own `stage/<name>/*`; a DEV binding cannot
reference PROD's. Trino query connectivity is the one deliberate exception:
`shared.query` is a single service used by every stage, isolated by catalog
rather than by endpoint, so `stages.<name>.query.endpoint` and `service_ref`
are not stage-scoped.

Ops artifacts are shared storage with a stage-specific activation prefix,
`activations/<stage>`. They do not define the revision manifest or promotion
workflow, which belong to #154 and #115.

## Logical and physical identity

Logical SQL is invariant across providers:

```text
lakehouse_<stage>.<owner>_<layer>.<table>
```

For example, every provider exposes DEV sales orders as
`lakehouse_dev.sales_silver.orders`. Business asset keys and descriptors do not
gain a stage prefix.

- Local: shared Polaris service, one physical Polaris catalog per stage, and
  distinct SeaweedFS Bronze, Silver, and Gold buckets per stage.
- Azure: shared Polaris service on AKS, one physical Polaris catalog per
  stage, and distinct SeaweedFS-on-AKS buckets per stage.
- AWS: every stage shares the account's one default Glue catalog (this
  account's Glue service rejects `CreateCatalog`, confirmed directly against
  the account — a native catalog per stage is not available), exposed through
  Trino's native Glue adapter, and distinct S3 buckets per stage.

Because every AWS stage shares one Glue catalog, `lakehouse_<stage>` is a
*logical* alias only there, not a distinct physical catalog: Trino's stage
catalog ID is the bare 12-digit AWS account ID, identical across stages.
Physical isolation instead comes from a `namespace_prefix` on every physical
Glue database/schema name —
`resolve_physical_names(namespace_prefix=f"{catalog_name}_")` renders
`sales_silver` as `lakehouse_dev_sales_silver` for DEV and
`lakehouse_prod_sales_silver` for PROD, so both stages' physical databases
coexist in the one shared catalog without colliding. Every consumer that
resolves a physical Glue name (Floe's per-domain profile rendering, `olf
catalog sync-namespaces`, dbt profile/source schema config) must apply this
same prefix — IAM scopes each stage's role to `database/<prefix>_*` regardless,
so an unprefixed name is simply denied rather than silently reading the wrong
stage's data. Trino's file-based access control adds a second, defense-in-depth
layer on top of that IAM scoping: a `tables` rule grants a stage's identity
full privileges only on its own `<prefix>_.*`-matching schemas within the
shared catalog, since the `catalogs` rule alone only gates which catalog a
client may use, not which schemas it can see once inside one.

`query.catalog_name` doubles as the name of the Trino catalog properties file
Terraform renders. v2 kept this separate from the Iceberg catalog name as
`trino_catalog_name`, deployed as the fixed value `iceberg` before #114. v3
collapses the two into one field, requiring it to equal `lakehouse_<stage>`;
every root now provisions the Trino catalog as `lakehouse_<stage>` rather than
`iceberg`.

The AWS adapter keeps native Glue rather than introducing another catalog
technology. It supplies the (shared) catalog ID, region, and
workload-identity reference; it never supplies credentials.

## Validation and migration

`tools/olf/tests/test_provider_contracts.py` validates the local, Azure, and
AWS fixture contracts against the published v3 JSON Schema and the typed
parser on every test run (`olf check contracts` covers the Terraform HCL
surface and rendered profile/Floe output; it does not re-run the fixture
suite). The parser rejects unknown fields and versions, missing or extra
topology stages, incomplete capability bindings, cross-stage storage/catalog
endpoint/identity references, duplicate stage storage/catalog/identity values,
unknown or mismatched catalog type/provider pairs, and provider/region/topology
mismatches.

The v2 adapter is intentionally temporary. It lifts a flat deployed contract
to one DEV stage without changing current v0.2 environment output. A v3
contract is not permitted to choose DEV implicitly: callers must select the
stage they are configuring.

## Stable capability interfaces

Consumers depend on fields such as storage URI and bucket, catalog type and
logical name, query endpoint, Secret reference, identity reference, and
artifact activation prefix. They do not depend on SeaweedFS, S3, Polaris, Glue,
kind, AKS, EKS, or a physical catalog name. See ADR 0003 for the binding
decision and ADR 0010 for the provider mappings.
