# OpenLakeForge — Architecture Charts

*How the platform is actually built, and how it actually runs — drawn the way Kubernetes
projects draw themselves.*

A cloud-agnostic, self-hostable lakehouse assembled on Kubernetes with Terraform and
Helm. Five charts in the official Kubernetes icon language: the pod-by-pod census, the
runtime wiring, the nested ephemeral jobs that do orchestration and ingestion (Bronze,
Silver — Gold executes as SQL in the long-lived Trino coordinator, not in a Job), the
medallion data path, and the provider contracts that make the platform modular. They
complement the product chart in
[../../assets/openlakeforge_v1.png](../../assets/openlakeforge_v1.png), which shows
*what* the platform does; these show *how*.

| **15** | **1+N** | **3** | **0** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pods at steady state — 9 Deployments, 6 StatefulSets | nested ephemeral Kubernetes Jobs per ingestion run — one run pod, one Floe Job per entity | deployment targets sharing one contract — kind, AKS, EKS | run/Floe pods between runs (Gold runs in Trino) |

### Reading key — used identically in every chart

| Signal | Means |
| --- | --- |
| Blue heptagon icon | Kubernetes workload — the badge names the kind (`deploy`, `sts`, `svc`, `secret`) |
| **Purple icon / dashed purple border** | **On-demand Job or CronJob** — created by something other than a Deployment, and never counted in the 15 |
| Green box | Long-lived service, grouped by Helm release |
| Blue box / badge | Control plane — Terraform, contracts, `olf` |
| Cylinder | Bucket or datastore; bronze / grey / amber follow the medallion layers |
| Orange | Managed service (AWS adapters) |

> Purple splits three ways by **what creates the Job**, which is also how chart 1 groups
> them. *Per pipeline run*: Dagster's `K8sRunLauncher` creates the run pod, which creates
> one Floe runner per entity — both TTL-collected within the hour, so the pipeline scales
> to zero between runs. *Bootstrap*: four Terraform `kubernetes_job_v1` resource blocks
> plus Superset's Helm hook — the SeaweedFS block uses `for_each` over four bucket names,
> so it alone creates four Jobs, for eight Jobs total, one shot per platform apply; the
> Helm hook is deleted on success and the rest persist until the next apply. *Scheduled*:
> two `kubernetes_cron_job_v1`
> resources on the cluster clock (log-archive every 15 min keeping 1 succeeded / 3 failed,
> OM catalog refresh hourly keeping 3 / 3), plus OpenMetadata's ingestion pipelines, which
> its own scheduler creates — not Terraform, and not Dagster.

## Chart 1 — Cluster Pod Census

*Every pod in the namespace, grouped by service — verified with `helm template` against
this repo's own values.*

Fifteen pods run at steady state: Dagster runs three (webserver, daemon, and the merged
`openlakeforge-dagster` code server loading `lakehouse_code.definitions`), SeaweedFS runs four
(three StatefulSets and an S3-gateway Deployment), Superset runs three, OpenMetadata
runs two, and PostgreSQL, Polaris, and Trino run one each. Trino is deliberately
coordinator-only.

The purple band underneath is everything that is *not* in that 15, split by what creates
it. **Per pipeline run**: the run pod and its Floe runners, TTL-collected within the hour,
so ingestion scales to zero between runs — Gold is the exception, running as SQL inside
the long-lived Trino coordinator above rather than in a Job. **Bootstrap**: five grouped
categories — Polaris, SeaweedFS (one Job per bucket, four buckets), PostgreSQL,
OpenMetadata, and Superset's Helm hook — eight one-shot Jobs in total, firing once per
the platform apply (phase 2). **Scheduled**: the two CronJobs on the cluster clock
(log archive every 15 minutes, OpenMetadata catalog refresh hourly).

## Chart 2 — Namespace Runtime Topology

*What talks to what — the service DNS on the wires is what consumers actually read from
the contracts.*

Superset queries Trino; Trino resolves tables through Polaris and reads data over s3a;
Polaris persists catalog state in PostgreSQL through JDBC, so a plain pod restart
preserves catalog and table identity. Polaris points at the Iceberg warehouse files in
SeaweedFS; Dagster, OpenMetadata, Superset, and Polaris share one PostgreSQL service.
The per-run pair does the data work: the run pod lands raw data in
object storage with **dlt**, launches the **Floe** runner (which authenticates to
Polaris and reads/writes SeaweedFS), then calls **Trino** through dbt-trino to build
Gold. Both Floe and dbt-trino also push OpenLineage events straight to OpenMetadata's
native endpoint — that lineage ingestion was restored, not deferred.

## Chart 3 — Ephemeral Job Lifecycle

*Launch → run pod → one Floe Job per entity → Gold via Trino → everything garbage-collected.*

The differentiating behavior: the Dagster run pod is itself an ephemeral Job, and it
creates **one Floe runner Job per entity** — sequentially, from an image declared in the
Floe manifest, not in the Dagster deployment — so a product with five entities (e.g.
`order_revenue`) runs five distinct Floe Jobs over the course of one pipeline run, never
concurrently. Ingestion upgrades without rebuilding the orchestrator image; failures
isolate per entity; TTL returns the per-run footprint to zero (Gold SQL executes in the
standing Trino service, not a per-run pod).

## Chart 4 — Medallion & Catalog Data Path

*Bucket = lane, and the Iceberg catalog governs Silver and Gold — one product traced end
to end.*

Raw data lands in Bronze as-is via dlt (CSV in the seed products, any raw source); the
Floe runner Job validates it against the contract and commits Silver Iceberg tables
through the catalog; dbt builds the Gold marts with the SQL executing **in Trino**
(dbt-trino). The catalog — Polaris locally, AWS Glue on the AWS POC — spans both curated
layers: per-product namespaces, allowed locations, and every write committed through it,
never to raw paths. Rejected rows are quarantined as CSV; exit code 0 covers
`success_or_rejected`.

## Chart 5 — Provider Contracts

*Engines consume interfaces, never implementations — swap the adapters, keep the
engines.*

The modularity chart. The engines across the top are byte-identical in every deployment;
the five contracts below are what they actually depend on (endpoint, buckets,
`catalog_type`, secret names), and those stay stable across all three targets. Each cell
names the adapter and the Terraform source that selects it — because swapping a provider
means the environment's root instantiates a *different module*, not just a different
value in `contracts.tf`.

Cell colour is the argument: grey means the module is the same one `local` uses, orange
means it was swapped. **`azure-poc` instantiates the same seven platform modules as
`local`** — SeaweedFS, Polaris, PostgreSQL, Trino, OpenMetadata, Superset, Dagster all
reuse the identical modules — and `contracts.tf` pins that with a `check
"azure_poc_keeps_s3_compatible_storage"` block. But the foundation root (AKS vs kind),
artifact registry (ACR vs kind image load), and identity adapter (AKS OIDC-ready vs local
dev credentials) do differ from the foundation's perspective; since the matrix groups
artifacts and foundation together, two Azure cells appear orange. `aws-poc` swaps a
different set: exactly three platform modules (`storage/aws-s3`, `catalog/aws-glue`,
`storage/rds-postgresql`) and reuses Trino, OpenMetadata, Superset, Dagster.

# Reference tables

*Comparisons and inventories — content that reads better as tables than as boxes.*

## Provider portability

| Contract | Local | Azure POC | AWS POC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | kind, 1 control-plane + 2 workers | AKS + ACR | VPC + EKS + node group + ECR |
| Object storage | SeaweedFS in-cluster | SeaweedFS on AKS | **S3** |
| Metadata database | PostgreSQL in-cluster | PostgreSQL in-cluster | **RDS PostgreSQL** |
| Iceberg catalog | Polaris REST | Polaris REST | **AWS Glue** |
| Container registry | kind image load | ACR | ECR |
| Workload identity | Kubernetes service account | AKS OIDC readiness | **EKS Pod Identity** — no static keys |
| Query + Gold engine | Trino | Trino | Trino |

`catalog_type` is the one field consumers branch on: `rest` selects the Polaris runtime
profile, `glue` the native Glue profile. Naming stays stable across Glue's two-level
model, so SQL and dbt models are unchanged. Not implemented (declared future adapters):
Keycloak, Vault/External Secrets, Traefik + cert-manager, Athena, Lake Formation, remote
Terraform state. OpenLineage is live, not deferred — Floe and dbt-trino emit lineage
events directly to OpenMetadata's native `openlineage` endpoint. The governance bootstrap
creates the endpoint credentials; runners receive them only through Secret references.
[ADR 0007](../../adr/0007-governance-and-lineage.md) covers the full history:
a normalising proxy first hid upstream correctness problems, lineage was then
deferred while those were fixed, and native emission was restored once Floe
and dbt-trino could target OpenMetadata's endpoint directly. The proxy and a
custom REST push both remain rejected.

## Three phases, one CD boundary

`olf deploy` runs three ordered phases: **foundation** (the cluster and
registry), **platform** (Terraform-managed services), then **artifacts**
(everything derived from `lakehouse_code/`). The CD boundary is not "foundation
is outside, the rest is the deploy" — it is the static/dynamic split between
platform and artifacts. A domain commit triggers the artifacts phase only; CI
never runs Terraform for a domain change ([ADR 0002](../../adr/0002-deployment-lifecycle.md)).

| Phase | Target | Deploys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Foundation | `olf deploy --provider local --phase foundation` | Terraform: the Kubernetes cluster + container registry — kind locally, EKS + ECR on AWS, AKS + ACR on Azure |
| 2 — Platform | `olf deploy --provider local --phase platform` | Terraform-managed platform resources: Helm releases for SeaweedFS, Polaris, Trino, OpenMetadata, Superset, Dagster — plus PostgreSQL, which Terraform creates directly as a StatefulSet + Service + bootstrap Job (no Helm release) |
| 3 — Artifacts | `olf deploy --provider local --phase artifacts` | **the CD phase** — dynamic artifacts: the project-code image (dbt code), Floe contracts + manifests, Superset dashboards, OpenMetadata data products |

Phases 1 and 2 are static infrastructure that Terraform owns; phase 3 is
dynamic and code-derived. `olf deploy --provider local` with no `--phase` chains
1 → 2 → 3; phases 1 and 2 are idempotent no-ops when nothing changed. Phase 3,
in order: load contract env → compile
Floe manifests → build + load
`project-code` → `olf artifacts upload-manifests` → `olf superset deploy-reports` →
`olf openmetadata deploy-metadata` → `olf k8s set-project-code-image`, which patches
the run-launcher ConfigMap, every Dagster deployment, and the log-archive CronJob to
the new image before waiting on each rollout — not a bare `kubectl rollout restart`.
CI validates structure, infrastructure, contracts, project-code, tooling, dbt, and
release readiness; pull requests also run the bounded slim kind smoke.

## Identity — one principal per engine

| Principal | Secret | Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trino | `polaris-trino-creds` | data-engineer / catalog-admin |
| floe | `polaris-floe-creds` | data-writer / catalog-writer |
| openmetadata | `polaris-om-creds` | data-reader / catalog-reader |
| (root) | `polaris-bootstrap-credentials` | bootstrap Job only |

dbt has **no** Polaris principal — the bootstrap deletes the old `polaris-dbt-creds`;
Gold SQL runs in Trino, so Gold catalog access uses `polaris-trino-creds`. Plus
`seaweedfs-s3-creds` for object storage. A leaked writer credential cannot
administer the catalog. Delivery is Terraform → Kubernetes Secret →
`envSecrets`/`envFrom` into long-lived pods *and* ephemeral Jobs; the Trino catalog file
holds `${ENV:...}` placeholders, never literal secrets. The AWS POC replaces static
storage keys entirely with EKS Pod Identity
([ADR 0010](../../adr/0010-cloud-provider-implementations.md)).

## Observability — object storage is the sink

No Loki/Grafana/Prometheus in v1 (`observability.object_log_archive`). Ephemeral pods
are deleted on TTL; their evidence is not:

```text
s3://openlakeforge-ops/
├── floe/manifests/{domain}/{domain}.manifest.json          ← olf artifacts upload-manifests
├── floe/reports/{domain}/                                  ← ephemeral Floe runner Job
├── logs/dagster/compute/                                   ← S3ComputeLogManager
├── logs/k8s/namespace={ns}/date={YYYY-MM-DD}/hour={HH}/    ← log-archive CronJob
└── run-artifacts/dbt/{domain}/{product}/{dagster_run_id}/  ← run pod, post-dbt-build
```

Only the dbt run-artifacts are keyed by Dagster run ID (`run-artifacts/dbt/{domain}/
{product}/{dagster_run_id}/`), so those are isolable per run after the pod is gone. Floe's
`report_base_uri` (set per manifest, e.g. `floe/reports/sales`) stops at the domain —
successive runs overwrite the same prefix, since
the runner's `base_args` carry no `--run-id`. The archived Kubernetes pod logs are
partitioned only by namespace / date / hour (`libs/k8s_log_archive.py`), so isolating a
single run from raw pod logs or from prior Floe reports needs a timestamp, not just a
prefix.

## Medallion-oriented code structure — the dynamic code

Everything in Phase ③ is **user code under `lakehouse_code/`**, and nothing about the
platform changes when a source, domain, or product is added. This is the "dynamic" half
of the platform (the artifacts phase); the charts above are the static half. Unlike the
pre-ADR-0026 layout, ownership is no longer domain-vertical: Bronze is source-owned,
Silver is domain-owned, Gold is product-owned, dashboards are consumption-owned, and each
concern still maps to exactly one engine:

```text
lakehouse_code/
├── lakehouse.yaml                            ← governance:      domain · data-product metadata           → OpenMetadata
├── definitions.py                            ← pipeline entry:  the Dagster Definitions the code server loads
├── bronze/<source>/                          ← source-owned

├── silver/<domain>/                          ← domain-owned

│       └── manifests/<domain>.manifest.json                     compiled, checksummed runner spec (baked + published)
├── gold/<product>/                           ← product-owned
│   └── dbt/models/gold/*.sql · sources.yml · schema.yml         Silver→Gold SQL                            → dbt-trino → Trino
├── pipelines/dagster/<product>.py            ← pipeline:        asset graph wiring bronze→floe→dbt        → Dagster
├── dashboards/superset/<dashboard>/          ← consumption-owned
│   └── metadata.yaml                                             charts · dashboards · datasets · databases → Superset
└── bronze/<source>/examples/*.csv                                seed data for the local demo
```

Two products can share one source-owned Bronze asset and one domain-owned Silver asset
without duplicating ingestion: `sales` (`order_revenue`, `customer_health`) uses one
`crm/accounts` asset and one `sales/accounts` asset, while `supply_chain`
(`inventory_reliability`) consumes `erp`. Adding a data product changes only its bronze,
silver, gold, dashboard, and pipeline slices, then runs the artifact phase.
`olf catalog sync-namespaces` derives the Bronze, Silver, and Gold namespaces from
`lakehouse.yaml` plus every `bronze/*/source.yaml` and reconciles them before Floe, dbt, or
OpenMetadata use them. A new product, domain, or source therefore needs no environment
Terraform edit or platform apply; see ADR 0002 and ADR 0004. `lakehouse_code/lakehouse.yaml`
is the canonical, human- and machine-readable descriptor of every domain and product.
